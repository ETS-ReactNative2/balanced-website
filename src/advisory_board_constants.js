export const ROBERT_PROFILE_TEXT = `I’m the last person you’d expect to be an advocate for healthy eating. I grew up on a farm in Iowa and, as a teenager, worked at my family’s restaurant serving up burgers and fried chicken. I spent four years in the Marines and over two decades in the Washington, D.C. police force before retiring as Captain.
I never gave a darn about what I ate. Neither did anyone I knew:  My fellow officers lived on fast food, and my relatives back home didn’t eat any better.

But over time, what they ate caught up to them. My dad died of a heart attack at 69. My mom has type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Many of my colleagues struggled with their weight and blood pressure.

Nearing my fifties, I decided to make a change. I started eating more grains, beans, fruits and vegetables, and less meat. It was a total transformation, and now I feel better than ever. Ask anyone who knows me and they’ll tell you I can’t shut up about the power of a healthy diet to change your life.

We all deserve to feel that good. We all deserve a life free of diet-related disease. But too often, it feels like major food corporations want to give us the opposite. That’s why I'm a part of Balanced:  I believe that together, we can hold corporations accountable and persuade them to put our health above their pockets. Because that’s the way it ought to be.`;
