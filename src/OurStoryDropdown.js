        It shouldn’t be this hard to feed our families well. We shouldn’t have to
        worry about nutrition when we send our kids to school or grab a bite in the
        office cafeteria. We shouldn’t struggle to find good food in the grocery
        store. And no one should wonder if the foods they’re serving will send their
        loved ones to an early grave.

        That’s why I created Balanced: so that families like yours and mine don’t
        have to bend over backward just to eat well. Together, we can make big
        food corporations take responsibility for their actions and demand they
        put our health first. We can’t wait any longer—the need is too urgent,
        and the consequences are too deadly.
